I'm Quynh Nguyen, a passionate advocate for the Internet of Things (IoT), whose love for this information technology was sparked during my formative years in a small countryside setting in Central Vietnam.

As a child, I grew up managing and maintaining the public Play Station services and the public Internet service.

Today, I'm on the way to leading [Digital Fortress](https://digitalfortress.dev/), a small IoT team with wizards dedicated to crafting exceptional IoT Products, Platforms, and Software as a Service (SaaS).
