# Maps Car Navigation

Here is my presentation about get a problem and solve that problem, included:
- The way I'm approaching to solve.
- Technology stacks.
- Workflow how it work.
- Database simple design.
- How to apply CI/CD.
- Some extended functions.

## 1. Problem:

> Maps Car Navigation is application (Web, iOS, Android) for Cars in Vietnam. This systems notify to driver on the car real time traffic info, and suggest for him the better ways. Auto push warning notification if nearby them has any accident (accidents information provided by other service). This device on the car can find all Gas stations/ATM/Restaurants circle 3 km if we choose.
We also use IoT devices to connect some services like Twitter, Facebook, Google,
Weather... to sync them with the Car Navigation app.

## 2. Scope:

### 2.1 Who:

- Minimum Viable Product phase:
  - Drivers
- Extended Large Scale Product phase:
  - Parent tracking babies
  - Organizations tracking delivery truck
  
### 2.2 What:

- Minimum Viable Product phase:
  - Notify traffic informations
  - Suggest the better ways
  - Notify about accident near by
  - Find services near by: Gas station/ATM/Restaurants
- Extended Large Scale Product phase:
  - Live View on Website and another devices
  - Communicate in same Group/Organization/Family
  - Find services near by: Gas station/ATM/Restaurants by Voice recognition

### 2.3 Where:
- Be used on the street

### 2.4 When:
- Be used when driving, moving on the street

### 2.5 Why:
- Avoid traffic congestion
- Suggest the fastest way to the destination
- Find nearest services easier

## 3. Workflow

## 5. Apply CI/CD
[Jenkins (CI/CD)](https://quynh-nguyen.github.io/devops/jenkins/)

## 6. Extended functions
- Live View on Website and another devices
- Communicate in same Group/Organization/Family
- Find services near by: Gas station/ATM/Restaurants by Voice recognition
